FIU Trace Format
The traces files (one per day) are in ASCII and each record is as follows:
[ts in ns] [pid] [process] [lba] [size in 512 Bytes blocks] [Write or Read] [major device number] [minor device number] [MD5 per 4096 Bytes]

In the case of the homes traces, the format is different for the digests:
[ts in ns] [pid] [process] [lba] [size in 512 Bytes blocks] [Write or Read] [major device number] [minor device number] [MD5 per 512 Bytes]

Disksim Trace Format
